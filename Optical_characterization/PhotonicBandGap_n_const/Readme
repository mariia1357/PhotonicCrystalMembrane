Periodic membrane cell that is represented as a Si3N4 square with a hole full of air inside.

Physics - Electromagnetic waves, Frequency domain; Study - Eigenfrequency

Parameters: Length of the unit cell a=932*10^(-9) m,
            Radious of the hole R=326*10^(-9) m.
            
Electric field propagates in perpendicular direction to the plane of the cell.
Physics ~ Electromagnetic waves ~ Electric field components solved for ~ Out-of-plane vector

Periodic condition for wave number in X and Y directions (half of the first Brullouin zone):
kx=pi/a*k; ky=pi/a*k; where k is a parameter.

For making mesh symmetrical: Edge ~ Copy edge ~ Free triangular

The frequency range: 0 - 3.4*10^14 Hz. 
For the laser with wavelengthh 1064nm - frequency is 2.8*10^14 Hz

Orientation of electric field vector in the graph:

0-1 x-direction;
1-2 y-direction
2-3 diagonal direction
